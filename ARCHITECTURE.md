# ARCHITECTURE — nexus

The nexus language: **spec + translator daemon** in one repo.

1. `spec/grammar.md` — the canonical Nexus Tier 0 grammar spec.
2. `spec/examples/` — canonical and illustrative `.nexus`
   files showing explicit request records.
3. `src/` — the daemon binary `nexus-daemon` plus the one-shot
   binaries `nexus-parse` and `nexus-render`. The daemon speaks
   **nexus text** on the client side (UDS at
   `/tmp/nexus.sock`) and **signal** (rkyv) on the criome side
   (UDS at `/tmp/criome.sock`); the one-shots are stdin/stdout
   wrappers around the same `Parser` / `Renderer` types for
   test pipelines and agent harnesses. Holds no sema state —
   purely a translator.

## Boundaries

Owns (`[lib]` + `[[bin]]` split):

- **The grammar spec** (under `spec/`). Stable;
  changes coordinated with
  nota-codec.
- **bin half** (`src/main.rs`): the daemon process — UDS
  listener at `/tmp/nexus.sock`, parsing, signal connection
  to criome, reply rendering.
- **lib half** (`src/lib.rs` + `src/error.rs`): daemon-specific
  helpers — typed errors and (soon) connection-state types
  + a request-routing actor.
- The **mechanical translation rule**: every nexus text
  construct has exactly one signal form, and vice versa.

Does not own:

- Lexer / Decoder / Encoder kernel — lives in
  nota-codec.
  Per-kind parsing of records, pattern records, verbs, and
  primitives is performed by the derives in
  nota-derive
  (`NotaRecord`, `NotaEnum`, `NotaTransparent`,
  `NotaTryTransparent`, `NexusPattern`, `NexusVerb`) which
  signal types apply.
- The signal envelope and per-verb typed IR — lives in
  signal.
- Sema state — that's criome's exclusive concern.
- The validator pipeline.

## Two messaging surfaces

The nexus daemon is the *only* place where these meet:

| Surface | Direction | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **client-facing** | client ↔ nexus | pure nexus text | the user's nexus expressions in / replies out |
| **signal** | nexus ↔ criome | rkyv | language IR for the twelve verbs (`Assert`, `Subscribe`, `Constrain`, `Mutate`, `Match`, `Infer`, `Retract`, `Aggregate`, `Project`, `Atomic`, `Validate`, `Recurse`) |

Nexus text is the only non-signal messaging surface in the
sema-ecosystem. It is transient — never persisted, never
rendered outside this daemon.

## Per-connection state

The daemon holds, per open connection:

- The negotiated protocol version (from the handshake).
- Open subscription registration (one subscription per
  connection; events stream until close).

Nothing else. No correlation-id mappings (replies pair to
requests by **position** on the connection — FIFO). No
fallback-file dispatch. No resume after disconnect (durable
work is criome-state, fetched via `Match`). No sema cache.

## Code map

│   └── examples/                 — canonical and illustrative .nexus files

    ├── listener.rs               — Listener actor: UDS accept loop, spawns Connection per accept
    ├── connection.rs             — Connection actor: per-client text shuttle (single-message Run lifecycle)
    ├── criome_link.rs            — CriomeLink struct: post-handshake signal connection (single-owner, not an actor)
    ├── parser.rs                 — Parser struct: current Criome parser; awaiting Tier 0 verb-record rewrite
    ├── renderer.rs               — Renderer struct: signal::Reply → Tier 0 text
    ├── main.rs                   — nexus-daemon entry: env config, Actor::spawn root Daemon, await join handle

        └── render.rs             — nexus-render: length-prefixed Frame on stdin → text on stdout
```

The supervision tree:

```text
Daemon (root)
  └── Listener
        ├── Connection × M  (one per accepted UDS client)
        └── ...
```

Per-actor file shape — each actor file exports `<Actor>` (ZST
behaviour marker) + `State` + `Arguments` + `Message`. Parser,
Renderer, and CriomeLink stay plain structs (single-owner,
non-concurrent — they're stateless transformers / one-call-at-a-time
sessions, not components warranting their own mailboxes). The
ractor framework is the project default for components with
state and a message protocol — see `lore/rust/ractor.md`.

## Invariants

- **Text crosses only at this boundary.** All daemon-to-daemon
  internal traffic is signal (rkyv). No raw nexus text reaches
  criome.
- **No state survives a request.** Per-connection state dies
  with the connection; durable state lives in criome's sema.
- **No correlation IDs.** Position pairs replies to requests.
- **One text construct, one typed value.** The mechanical
  translation rule is the perfect-specificity
  invariant
  seen at the text↔signal boundary. Every nexus text construct
  names exactly one typed shape; every typed shape has exactly
  one canonical text rendering. The daemon never instantiates
  a generic record and figures out its kind later — it parses
  text directly into the precise typed payload of the verb
  the text expresses (`Assert(Node { … })`,
  `Mutate(MutateOperation { … })`,
  `Match(GraphQuery { … })`). Failure to parse
  into a known kind is a parse-time error, not a downstream
  validation miss.

## Status

**Renovating.** The spec is being renovated to Nexus Tier 0: records,
sequences, explicit request records, `@`, and schema-driven
`PatternField<T>` decoding. The renderer now emits named `SlotBinding`
records for slotted query replies. The current parser still carries the
previous Criome-specific M0 surface until `signal` is rebased onto the
twelve-verb contract. Domain-parameterizing the daemon waits until a second
concrete translator exists.

## What nexus-daemon does — and only that

The nexus daemon does **one thing**: translate between nexus text
and signal. In both directions. Nothing else.

- text in → signal out (parsing)
- signal in → text out (rendering)

It does not hold sema state. It does not validate beyond
syntactic well-formedness. It does not remember anything across
requests except the per-connection handshake/subscription state
needed to keep ordered replies flowing. It does not read records,
write records, or know what a record means. Translation is the
whole job.

This bright-line scope makes the daemon usable in two distinct
roles, both reducing to the same translation primitive:

- **Text-client gateway.** Humans, agents, shell scripts, and
  LLM tools send nexus text to the daemon's UDS; the daemon
  parses to signal, forwards to criome, renders the reply back
  to text.
- **Rendering service.** Other signal-speaking clients (mentci-*
  GUIs being the first) speak signal directly to criome but
  also hold a connection to the nexus daemon and use it to
  render typed signal payloads as nexus text for human display
  (inspector views, wire-pane frame display, hover labels). The
  same daemon, the same primitive, used as a service rather
  than a gateway.

In both roles the daemon is a translator. New clients do not
extend nexus's scope — they consume the translation primitive
from whichever side they need.

## Clients connecting directly to criome

Anything that wants to *talk to* criome speaks signal. The nexus
daemon is one such speaker (forwarding the parsed signal from
its text clients). Others connect directly:

- **mentci-* GUIs** — speak signal to criome for editing and
  subscriptions; *additionally* speak signal to nexus-daemon for
  rendering as described above.
- **direct signal speakers** — agents written in Rust, CI
  harnesses, integration tests, any binary linking signal.

Nexus is not a required intermediary for criome access; it is
the text translation primitive that humans and rendering clients
both consume.

## Parser + renderer wire-in for new verbs

Adding a new signal verb (the planned `Compile` / `BuildRequest`
post-MVP, plus any future verb) lands in three places:

1. The verb's typed payload + closed-enum variant in
   signal.
2. A new arm in [`Parser`](src/parser.rs) — verb-record dispatch from the
   PascalCase verb head to the typed payload.
3. A new arm in [`Renderer`](src/renderer.rs) — typed reply →
   nexus text, one canonical rendering per typed shape.

The mechanical-translation rule (one text construct, one typed
value) extends to every verb the daemon translates; new verbs
slot into the parser/renderer per-variant dispatch without adding sigils or
grammar slots.

## Cross-cutting context

- Project-wide architecture:
  criome/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Signal (the rkyv form on the criome leg):
  signal/ARCHITECTURE.md
- nota-codec (text codec used both for parsing client requests
  and rendering replies):
  nota-codec/ARCHITECTURE.md
